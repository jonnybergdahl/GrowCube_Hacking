# GrowCube_Hacking

These are my notes reverse engineering the protocl used in Growcube. 

I have used Jadx to reverse engineer the Android app to get some insights in how the protocol works. 

> Note: This is still very much a work in progress

## Python script

The python script `growcube_packet_decoder.py` can be used to connect to a Growcube. It dumps the data section and displays the parsed message in a readable format.

```
Connecting to Growcube at 172.30.2.202

```

## Communication

The device has a TCP port open onÂ port 8800, connect to that using a raw socket, and it starts to peridocally write out messages. It also support accepting commands.

This is a sample output running Telnet, I just added a line feed to separate different messages.

## Message format

The messages are composed by the following parts.

Part | Description
---- | ----
"elea" | Message header
XX | Command/Response
"#" | Delimiter
NN | Length of the following data
data | Data, delimited by # delimiters and sub delimited by @ characters
"#" | End of data

## Response values

Value | Description | Attributes | Sample value
---- | ---- | ---
20 | RepWaterState | Water warning? | 1
21 | RepSTHSate | pump #, "st", "th", temperature | 0@50@49@24
22 | RepCurve | ?? |
23 | RepAutoWater | pump #, time stamp divided in separate strings |
24 | RepVersionAndWater | version number (Probably water warning as well?) | 3.6@12663500
25 | RepErasureData | Erasure state |
26 | RepPumpOpen | pump # | 3
27 | RepPumpClose | pump # | 3
33 | (Unknown) | ?? | 0@0

## Command values
Value | Description | Attributes
---- | ---- | ---
43 | SetWorkmode ?? | mode
44 | SyncTime | Current time
45 | PlantEnd ?? | pump #
46 | ClosePump | pump #
47 | Water | pump #, state
48 | CurveData | pump #
49 | WaterMode | sub data: pump #, mode, min value, max value
50 | WifiSettings | sub data: WiFi name, WiFi password, time mils

Command `ele502` is SyncWaterLevel
Command `ele503` is SyncWaterTime
Command `ele504` is Device upgrade command
Command `ele505` is Factory reset command
