# GrowCube_Hacking

These are my notes reverse engineering the protocl used in Growcube. 

I have used Jadx to reverse engineer the Android app to get some insights in how the protocol works. 

> Note: This is still very much a work in progress

## Python script

The python script `growcube_packet_decoder.py` can be used to connect to a Growcube. It dumps the data section and displays the parsed message in a readable format.

```
Connecting to Growcube at 172.30.2.202

[ 10#3@29@48@24# ] - RepSTHSate: pump: 3, sh: 29, th: 48, temperature: 24
```

## Communication

The device has a TCP port open onÂ port 8800, connect to that using a raw socket, and it starts to peridocally write out messages. It also support accepting commands.

This is a sample output running Telnet, I just added a line feed to separate different messages.

```
Connected to 172.30.2.202.
Escape character is '^]'.
elea24#12#3.6@12663500#

elea21#10#2@23@45@25#
elea21#10#3@15@45@25#
```

Using Wireshark reveals the server is sending more data than Telnet shows.

### App communication

When the app starts, it connects to the Growcube and starts communication. 

The app starts by sending a `SyncTime` command with the current data and time. 
The device responds with a `RepVersionAndWater` response.

```
> elea44#19#2023@07@12@22@49@05#
< elea24#12#3.6@12663500#
```

The app sends a `SetWorkmode` command for mode `2`. It the continues
asking for data with a `CurveData` command for plant 0.

```
> elea43#1#2#
> elea48#1#0#
< elea22#83#0@2023@7@12@00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,95,96,00#
```

The Growcube then sends out it's usual data stream.

```
< elea35#3#0@1#elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@38#
< elea35#3#0@1#elea23#16#0@2023@6@19@6@38#

```
